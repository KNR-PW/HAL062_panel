 This is the official HAL-\/062 operational panel documentation. It consists of description of the code variables and most important functions.

The panel constitutes of several switches, potentiometers, lights and 3 joysticks. The system uses communications standards like I2C, CAN, UART, and bluetooth and ethernet modules, which are supposed to engage communication with the rover.

Project consists of files specifying operation of each module, which are located in /\+Modules folder. Used communication standards and modules\+:
